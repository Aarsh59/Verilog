# Verilog
This is a self Project aimed to design modules in Verilog Language which are applicable in real life application, The modules that I have made in this self project are as follows:
1.) a voting machine for 4 candidates featuring 2 modes: mode0 enables incrementing the vote count for a candidate when their button is pressed, while mode1 displays the total votes for that candidate using LEDs to represent the bits."
